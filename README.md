# Watch Faces

This is a collection of watch faces made with [WatchMaker](http://watchmaker.haz.wiki/) for _Android Wear_.

# Collaboration

You are welcome to collaborate developing the watch faces to bring them to the next level in functionality and quality.
As I only can test on a circular watch, especially squared adaptions are very welcome.

# Distribution

The watch faces are usually distributed on [WatchAwear](http://www.watchawear.com/) and
[FaceRepo](https://facerepo.com/app/faces/user/IOIO72/).
